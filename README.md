# The Roaster ðŸ”¥

A fun hackathon project that generates personalized roasts based on user information, complete with AI-generated caricatures.

## Description

The Roaster is a web application where visitors can input their personal information and receive a humorous, satirical roast generated by AI. Each roast includes:
- A personalized satirical description based on their hobbies, nationality, and astrology sign
- An AI-generated caricatural portrait
- A spot on the public leaderboard showcasing all generated roasts

## Features

- **User Input Form**: Collect name, birthdate, hobbies, and nationality
- **AI-Powered Roasting**: Generate witty, stereotypical roasts using LLM via Vercel AI SDK
- **Astrology Integration**: Determine zodiac sign from birthdate
- **AI Portrait Generation**: Create caricatural images using AI image models
- **Public Leaderboard**: Browse all previously generated roasts
- **No Authentication**: Fully public and accessible to everyone

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript (Vite)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/Database**: Convex
- **AI Integration**: Vercel AI SDK (via Convex Actions)
- **File Storage**: Convex File Storage

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- Convex account
- OpenAI/Anthropic API key (for LLM)
- Image generation API key (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local

# Run Convex dev server
pnpm convex dev

# Start the development server
pnpm dev
```

## Environment Variables

### Frontend (.env.local)
```
VITE_CONVEX_URL= # Your Convex deployment URL
```

### Convex Environment Variables (set via Convex dashboard)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY= # or other LLM provider
IMAGE_API_KEY= # for image generation (e.g., Replicate, DALL-E)
```

## Project Structure

```

## Architecture Notes

- **API Keys Security**: All LLM and image generation API calls are handled through Convex Actions (server-side), keeping API keys secure
- **No Direct API Calls**: The React frontend never directly calls external APIs, only Convex functions
- **File Storage**: Generated images are stored in Convex File Storage, not exposed to the client
